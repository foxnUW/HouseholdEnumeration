# Household Enumeration

----

Developer Design and Development exercise for Expeditors new hire process.

See the [design doc](design.md) for an overview of the design. See the [JavaDoc](docs/index.html) for detailed 
documentation of the project.

Input is expected as a text file, given as the command line argument, formatted as in the prompt. See the design doc 
for an example.

To run, either build the project (I used IntelliJ as the build system) or run the `HouseholdEnumeration.jar` file:

```
java -jar HouseholdEnumeration.jar <path_to_input_file>
```
